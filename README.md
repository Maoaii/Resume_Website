### Development RoadMap
I started learning Web Development in the summer of 2022. I've always wanted to build my very own website so I learned a bit of HTML and CSS in Angela Yu's 100 Day Python Bootcamp and got to work on my own project.

I've had a bit of trouble with the layout of the Website as i'm not really used to being artistically creative in programming. However, after a bit of tinkering I think I landed on a design that's simple and good-looking.

I learned how to use "div" a bit more widely and understood how to develop isolated sections on a single website.

What i've had the most trouble with (and still have) is the responsiveness side of things. When viewed from a PC, the website looks as I intended, but, on smaller screens, text overlaps and containers stretch a whole lot. Atleast I now know where to tackle this problem so, in the near future, i'm going to fix those issues.

This was a pretty fun experience and I really liked Web Development. Next up, i'm going to fix this website's bugs and then start learning a framework for JS like Vue.js.
